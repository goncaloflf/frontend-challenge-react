# Datepicker Challenge

Dear reviewer,
I want to thank you for your time reading this challenge. This challenge was done in 5hrs (you'll find more between commits, but I had dinner and watched a football match in between, hence the extra 2 hours).

This challenge was done in React. Although I am aware that Vue was the preferred framework to use, I am more familiar with React and it would take me far more than 4hrs to complete this.

## Assumptions

When developing this solution, some assumptions were made:

- Using the [shortcuts](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#datetime/daterangepicker) from Blueprintjs is not an acceptable way of implementing the Bonus part - I assumed it had to be coded from scratch.
- Date picker default value is one week, last day is the current day.
- I didn't take the UI/UX into much consideration - the main focus was to implement the funcionality asked.
- Regarding Code Style, all code is ESLint compliant. Checkout my `.eslintrc` config file for more information.

## Getting started

This project was developed using create-react-app.
Yarn was the package manager used, as it was already configured on my machine. The following commands can be executed with NPM as well (I did not test it, but I am confident there will be no problems).

## Project setup

```
yarn | npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn start | npm start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build | npm build
```

### Run your unit tests

```
yarn test | npm test
```
